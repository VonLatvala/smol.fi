## Development
Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
Run `docker.sh`, possibly replacing the `\`pwd\`/public_html` with the absolute path to public_html.
When the terminal is up, run `webserver start`, this starts a php-enabled docker container on localhost:8000
Navigate to [the dev env](http://localhost:8000)
